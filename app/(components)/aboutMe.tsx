            <p>
                I'm a french producer from France, 23yo and slowly coming back after a break with my passion.

                I started around 2017 with some type beats and moved fast into some "hard trap" oriented composition.<br/>
                The goal was to push the limit of my sound to something more authentic, original and without the need of a vocalist to complete each project.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few months after, I discovered the wave genre (still pretty close to the trap one imo) and started mixing trap and wave styles.<br/>
                I'm still experiencing trap mixed with wave even deeper and also something new : techno.<br/>
                Yes, as an artist finding your own world is hard but trying different things can be fun and help you find new ways to express yourself.
